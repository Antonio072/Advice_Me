## Where can I download it?
Right now it's only possible to use in [Mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/advice-me/)

## How can I contribute?
You just submit your quotes **in English** doing pull request, editing the js' file and adding your quote. **Please** add it to the end

If you don't know about Git, you can make a issue too.

### Example for make a PR with new quotes
Edit this [js file](https://github.com/fcoterroba/Advice_Me/blob/main/background.js) and you'll see this first line
```js
var randomArray = [
    "“All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.”",
    "........",
    "“That's my new quote”"
```
Remember add **comma** at the end of the sentence if you are going to write more than one.

Remember which your last sentencer WON'T have **comma**
