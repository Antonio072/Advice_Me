## How can I contribute?
You just submit your quotes **in English** doing pull request, editing the js' file and adding your quote. **Please** add it to the end

If you don't know about Git, you can make a issue too.

### Example for make a PR with new quotes
Edit this [js file](https://github.com/fcoterroba/Advice_Me/blob/main/background.js) and you'll see this first line
```js
var randomArray = [
    "“All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.”",
    "........",
    "“That's my new quote”"
```
Remember add **comma** at the end of the sentence if you are going to write more than one.

Remember which your last sentencer WON'T have **comma**

## Update for Hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest is a promotion run by DigitalOcean that runs every October in order to encourage developers to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. You can read more info in [their official website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

This repository has been accepted in order to accept Hacktoberfest issues. 

Remember that only mergues made between 1 and 31 October will be valid. I'll try not merge nothing until then but I ask for don't do PR until then too. You can "reserve" some issues by requesting it and doing the PR in October
